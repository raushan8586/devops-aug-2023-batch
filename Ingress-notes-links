Ingress --> url/path-based routing

abc1234.com/path1 --> microservices1 service
abc1234.com/path2 --> microservices2 service
abc1234.com/path3 --> microservices3 service

Ingress
1. ingress controller --> deploy this in the cluster to read the ingress resource --> nginx ingress Controller  (others Ingress Controllers --> AWS ALB, Traefik, HA Proxy)
2. ingress resource --> yaml with the rules
